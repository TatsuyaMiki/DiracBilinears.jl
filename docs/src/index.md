# DiracBilinears

This document provides usage for [DiracBilinears](https://github.com/TatsuyaMiki/DiracBilinears.jl).

This package provides tools for computing microscopic physical quantities in relativistic quantum theory called Dirac bilinears, which are the fundamental 16 independent quantities derived from the Dirac field.
By connecting to the external first-principles calculation package [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org), [Wannier90](https://wannier.org), and [wan2respack](https://github.com/respack-dev/wan2respack) ([RESPACK](https://sites.google.com/view/kazuma7k6r)), it can evaluate
- spatial distributions of the bilinears
- Wannier matrix elements of the bilinears
